<think>The error message shows that there's a `NameError: name 'BLACK' is not defined`. This means the code is trying to use a variable called `BLACK` that hasn't been defined in the scope where it's being used.

Looking at the main.py file, I can see that it imports from a module called `constants` with the line `from constants import *`. This suggests that the `BLACK` constant should be defined in a constants.py file.

Let's first check if the constants.py file exists and what it contains:</think>I see the issue. There's an error when running the Asteroids game: `NameError: name 'BLACK' is not defined`. This means the BLACK color constant that's being used to fill the screen background isn't defined, although it should be imported from the constants module.

Let's first check if the constants.py file exists and what it contains:

Great! I found the constants.py file. Let's check its contents to see if the BLACK constant is defined there:

Read file: undefined

Now I see the problem. The constants.py file exists, but it doesn't define a BLACK constant which is needed for the screen.fill(BLACK) line in main.py.

In Pygame, color constants like BLACK are typically defined as RGB tuples. I'll edit the constants.py file to add the BLACK color constant (which should be (0, 0, 0) for black):

```diff
  SCREEN_WIDTH = 1280
  SCREEN_HEIGHT = 720
+ 
+ # Colors
+ BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
+ WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
+ RED = (255, 0, 0)
+ GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
+ BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
  
  ASTEROID_MIN_RADIUS = 20
```

I've added the BLACK color constant to your constants.py file, which was causing the error. I also added some other common color constants (WHITE, RED, GREEN, BLUE) that might be useful for your Asteroids game in the future.

Now the `screen.fill(BLACK)` line in your main.py file should work correctly. The BLACK constant is defined as the RGB tuple (0, 0, 0), which represents the color black.

Try running your game again with:

```
python3 main.py
```

The game should now start properly with a black screen background. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!
